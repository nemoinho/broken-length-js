= Broken length JS

[abstract]
Oh now, `Array.length` is broken, how can we know the amount of anything, now?

This project is a quiz that forces you to think outside the box.
In fact the property `.length` is arguably one of the most important features of javascript at all.
However in our Scenario the length-method is broken and will always return another value, but rarely the correct one.

Your task is the development of an method which will return the correct length of an array without the usage of `.length`.
To identify a correct solution I've defined a bunch of tests, which can be used to check your solution.

Just implement the function in `xref:index.js[]` and execute the tests to check your implementation.

[source,bash]
node index.spec
